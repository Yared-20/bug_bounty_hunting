                    <h2>What is OWASP?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mark Curphey founded the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) in 2001 (owasp.org). 
Their project includes a number of open-source software development programs and toolkits, local chapters and conferences, among other things.
one of their projects is the maintenance of the  OWASP Top 10 , a list of the top 10 security risks faced by web applications. 
OWASP focuses on pentesting web applications specifically. This nonprofit organization now has just over a handful of employees, but well over 10,000 volunteers. 
OWASP develops specific web application security testing standards and offers educational programs to the general public.
                    </p>
                    <h2>OWASP Testing Guide</h2>
                    <p>
                        Otherwise known as OWASP’s WSTG (web security testing guide), 
this is a guide to testing the security of web applications offered by OWASP.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Tools</h2>
                    <p>There are a lot of tools offered by OWASP, some are :-</p>

                    <h1 class="ar-h">OWASP Top 10</h1>
                <div class="ar-p">
                    <p>
                        The OWASP TOP 10 is a standard awareness document for developers and web application security.
it represents a broad consensus about the most critical security risks to web application.
                    </p>
                    <h2>1. Injection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS and LDAP, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. 
Injection flaws are very prevalent, particularly in legacy code, And they are easy to discover when examining code.
Scanners and Fuzzers can help attackers find injection flaws.
                    </p>
                    <h2>2. Broken Authentication and Session Management</h2>
                    <p>
                        This category of vulnerability encompasses various defects within the application’s login mechanism, which 
may enable an attacker to guess weak passwords, launch a brute-force attack, or bypass the login.
Session management attacks are well understood, particularly in relation to unexpired session tokens.
Attackers can detect broken authentication using manual means and exploit them using automated tools with password lists and dictionary attacks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>3. Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
                    <p>
                        This mainly involves interacting 
with the application in unexpected and malicious ways and exploiting anomalies in the application’s behavior to extract information that is of value to you. 
If successful, such an attack may enable you to retrieve sensitive data such as user credentials, gain a deeper understanding of an error condition to fi ne-tune 
your attack, discover more details about the technologies in use, and map the application’s internal structure and functionality.
                    </p>
                    <h2>4. XML External Entity</h2>
                    <p>
                        Attackers can exploit vulnerable XML processors if they can upload XML or include hostile content in an XML document, exploiting vulnerable code, dependencies or integrations.
By default, many older XML processors allow specification of an external entity, a URL that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
These flaws can be used to extract data, excute a remote request from the server, scan internal systems, perform a denial-of-serrvice attack, as well as execute other attacks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>5. Broken Access Control</h2>
                    <p>
                        This involves cases where the application fails to properly protect access to its data and functionality, 
potentially enabling an attacker to view other users’ sensitive data held on the server or carry out privileged actions (creating, accessing, updating or deleting ).
Access control weaknesses are common due to lack of automation detection, and lack of effective functional testing by application developers.
Access control is detectable using manual means, or possibly through automation for the absence of access controls in certain frameworks.
                    </p>
                    <h2>6. Security Misconfiguration</h2>
                    <p>
                        Attackers will often attempt to exploit unpatched flaws or access default accounts, unused pages, unprotected files and directories, 
to gain unauthorized access or knowledge of the system.
Security misconfiguration can happen at any level of an application stack, including the network services, platform, web server, application server,
database, frameworks, custom code, and preinstalled virtual machines, containers, or storage.
Automated scanners are useful for dettecting misconfigurations, use of default accounts or configurations, unnecessary services, legacy options, etc.
                    </p>
                    <h2>7. Cross-Site Scripting</h2>
                    <p>
                        This vulnerability enables an attacker to target other users of the application, potentially gaining access to their data, 
performing unauthorized actions on their behalf, or carrying out other attacks against them.
Automated tools can detect and exploit all three forms of XSS, particularly in mature technologies such as PHP, J2EE/JSP, and ASP.NET.
                    </p>
                    <h2>8. Insecur De-serialization</h2>
                    <p>
                    # Serialization is the process of converting complex data structures, such as objects and their fields, into a "flatter" format that can be sent and received as a sequential stream of bytes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    # Deserialization is the process of restoring this byte stream to a fully functional replica of the original object, in the exact state as when it was serialized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So, Insecure deserialization is when user-controllable data is deserialized by a website. This potentially enables an attacker to manipulate serialized objects in order to pass harmful data into the application code.
                    </p>
                    <h2>9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        While it is easy to find already-written exploits for many known vulnerablities, other vulnerabilities require concentrated effort to
develop a custom exploit.
also some known vulnerabilities lead to only minor impacts, some of the largest breaches to date have relied on exploiting known 
vulnerabilities in components.
Some scanners help in detection, but determining exploitablity requires additional effort.
                    </p>
                    <h2>10. Insufficent Logging&Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>
                        Exploitation of Insufficent Logging&Monitoring is the bedrock of nearly every major incident. 
Attackers rely on the lack of monitoring and timely response to achieve their goals without being detected.
Most successful attack start with vulnerability probing.
