                    <h2>Web Applications</h2>
                    <p>
                    In the early days of the Internet, the World Wide Web consisted only of web sites. These were essentially information repositories containing static documents. 
Web browsers were invented as a means of retrieving and displaying those documents. The flow of interesting information was one-way, from server to browser. Most sites did not authenticate users, 
because there was no need to. Each user was treated in the same way and was presented with the same information. Any security threats arising from hosting a website were related largely to vulnerabilities in web server software (of 
which there were many). If an attacker compromised a web server, he usually would not gain access to any sensitive information, because the information 
held on the server was already open to public view. Rather, an attacker typically would modify the files on the server to deface the web site’s contents or use the 
server’s storage and bandwidth to distribute “warez.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the World Wide Web is almost unrecognizable from its earlier form. The majority of sites on the web are in fact applications.
    They are highly functional and rely on two-way fl ow of information between the server and browser. They support registration and login, financial transactions, 
    search, and the authoring of content by users. The content presented to users is generated dynamically on the fly and is often tailored to each specific user. 
    Much of the information processed is private and highly sensitive. Security, therefore, is a big issue. No one wants to use a web application if he believes 
    his information will be disclosed to unauthorized parties.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Web Application Security</h2>
                    <p>
                        Web applications bring with them new and significant security threats. Each application is different and may contain unique vulnerabilities.
    Most applications are developed in-house many by developers who have only a partial understanding of the security problems that may arise in the code they are producing.
    To deliver their core functionality, web applications normally require connectivity to internal computer systems that contain highly sensitive data and that can perform powerful business functions.
                    </p>
                    <h3><b>NB</b> So, the point here is the best wey to attack something is by knowing how it work. For that reason i provide the basics of web-dev.</h3>

                <h1 class="ar-h">HTML/CSS</h1>
            <div class="ar-p">
                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>
                    HTML is a markup language for describing web documents (web pages).
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. A markup language is a set of markup tags
HTML documents are described by HTML tags. Each HTML tag describes different document content.
                </p>
                <h2>XHTML</h2>
                <p>
                    XHTML is a development of HTML that is based on XML and that has a stricter specifi cation than older versions of HTML. Part of the motivation for XHTML 
was the need to move toward a more rigid standard for HTML markup to avoid the various compromises and security issues that can arise when browsers are 
obligated to tolerate less-strict forms of HTML.
                </p>
                <h2>What Is DOM?</h2>
                <p>
                    The Document Object Model (DOM) is an abstract representation of an HTML document that can be queried and manipulated through its API.
The DOM allows client-side scripts to access individual HTML elements by their id and to traverse the structure of elements programmatically. Data such 
as the current URL and cookies can also be read and updated. 
The DOM also includes an event model, allowing code to hook events such as form submission, navigation via links, and keystrokes. 
Manipulation of the browser DOM is a key technique used in Ajax-based applications.
                </p>
                <h3><b>NB</b> As i said i am not here for web-dev, so lets talk why we need this.</h3>
                <h2>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</h2>
                <p>
                    Web pages are made up of HTML code whose elements describe the 
page’s structure and contents. In an XSS attack, the attacker injects an executable script into HTML pages 
viewed by the user. HTML also allows the inclusion of executable scripts within HTML 
documents using "script" tags. Websites use these scripts to control client-side application logic and make the website interactive.
Scripts  that are embedded within an HTML file instead of loaded from a separate file are called inline scripts. These scripts are the cause of many XSS vulnerabilities.  
This means that to understand XSS, you’ll have to first understand JavaScript and HTML syntax.
                </p>
                <h2>Clickjacking</h2>
                <p>
                    Clickjacking relies on an HTML feature called an iframe. HTML iframes allow developers to embed one web page within another by placing an 
"iframe" tag on the page, and then specifying the URL to frame in the tag’s "src" attribute. 
Iframes are useful for many things. The online advertisements you 
often see at the top or sides of web pages are examples of iframes; companies use these to include a premade ad in your social media or blog. Iframes 
also allow you to embed other internet resources, like videos and audio, in your web pages.
Iframes have made our internet a more vibrant and interactive place. 
But they can also be a danger to the framed web page because they introduce the possibilities of a clickjacking attack.
                </p>
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used to describe the presentation of a 
document written in a markup language. Within web applications, it is used to 
specify how HTML content should be rendered on-screen (and in other media, 
such as the printed page).
In the earliest days of web application security, CSS was largely overlooked 
and was considered to have no security implications. Today, CSS is increasingly 
relevant both as a source of security vulnerabilities in its own right and as a 
means of delivering effective exploits for other categories of vulnerabilities.
                </p>
                <p>~ Attacks that uses css are more of Client-Side Injection Attacks.</p>
                <p class="final">Finally, this was just an example and it is hard to list all attacks that need HTML/CSS knowledge so is good time to master them.</p>

            <h1 class="ar-h">JavaScript</h1>
        <div class="ar-p">
            <h2>What is javaScript?</h2>
            <p>
                You should also learn to read JavaScript, the language with which most sites are written. 
Reading the JavaScript of a site can teach you about how it works, giving you a fast track to finding bugs. 
Many top hackers say that their secret sauce is that they read JavaScript and search for hidden end points, insecure programming logic, and secret keys. 
Some also found many vulnerabilities by reading JavaScript source code.
            </p>
            <p>JavaScript is a relatively simple but powerful programming language that can be easily used to extend web interfaces in ways that are not possible using HTML alone.</p>
            <p>It is commonly used to perform the following tasks :-</p>
            <p>
                ~ Validating user-entered data before it is submitted to the server to avoid 
unnecessary requests if the data contains errors.
            </p>
            <p>
                ~ Dynamically modifying the user interface in response to user actions for 
example, to implement drop-down menus and other controls familiar 
from non-web interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                ~ Querying and updating the document object model (DOM) within the 
browser to control the browser’s behavior (the browser DOM is described 
in a moment).
            </p>
            <h2>JavaScript Hijacking</h2>
            <p>
                JavaScript hijacking provides a further method of capturing data cross-domain, turning CSRF into a limited “two-way” attack.
The same-origin policy allows one domain to include script code from another domain, and this code executes in the context of the invoking domain, not the 
issuing domain.

            <h1 class="ar-h">PHP</h1>
        <div class="ar-p">
            <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
            <p>
                PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor", is a widely-used, open source scripting language.
PHP scripts are executed on the server &  is free to download and use.<br>
            It is powerful enough to be at the core of the biggest blogging system (WordPress)!<br>
            It is deep enough to run the largest social network (Facebook)!<br>
            It is also easy enough to be a beginner's first server side language!<br>
PHP can generate dynamic page content can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server,
collect form data, send and receive cookies, add, delete, modify data in your database, 
can be used to control user-access, encrypt data.<br>
With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. You can output images, PDF files, and even Flash movies. 
You can also output any text, such as XHTML and XML.
            </p>
            <h2>Why PHP?</h2>
            <p>
                PHP runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.),
 is compatible with almost all servers used today (Apache, IIS, etc.),
supports a wide range of databases, is free. Download it from the official PHP resource: www.php.net, 
is easy to learn and runs efficiently on the server side.
            </p>
            <h2>Dynamic Execution Vulnerabilities</h2>
            <p>
                Dynamic execution vulnerabilities most commonly arise in languages such as PHP and Perl. But in principle, any type of application platform may pass 
user-supplied input to a script-based interpreter, sometimes on a different back-end server. <br>
The PHP function eval is used to dynamically execute code that is passed to the function at runtime.
            </p>
            <h2>Remote File Inclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The PHP language is particularly susceptible to file inclusion vulnerabilities because its include functions can accept a remote file path. 
This has been the basis of numerous vulnerabilities in PHP applications.
            </p>
            <p class="final">It known that php is most used language in the server-side. so, knowing how to use it will open a smooth way to file access from a server.</p>

            <p>
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
                It is used for:- <br>
                web development (server-side), <br>
                software development, <br>

            <h2>Why PYTHON?</h2>
            <p>
                Python is very easy to learn for newcomers and beginners. It has simplified
syntax so anybody can easily read and understand the code. There are lots of
tools and modules available for python to do our tasks by writing a few lines

            <p>
                Django is a free, open source web framework written in the Python programming language.
A “web framework” is software that abstracts away many of the common challenges related to
building a website, such as connecting to a database, handling security, user accounts, and so
on. These days most developers rely on web frameworks rather than trying to build a website
truly from scratch. Django in particular was first released in 2005 and has been in continuous
development since then. Today, it is one of the most popular web frameworks available, used
by the largest websites in the world–Instagram, Pinterest, Bitbucket, Disqus–but also flexible
enough to be a good choice for early-stage startups and prototyping personal projects.

            <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
            <p>
                Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to access data in relational databases, such as Oracle, MS-SQL server and MySQL. 
The vast majority of today’s web applications employ SQL-based databases as their back-end data store, and nearly 
all application functions involve interaction with these data stores in some way.
Although SQL is an ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard, there are different versions of the SQL language.
However, to be compliant with the ANSI standard, they all support at least the major commands (such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, WHERE) in a similar manner.
            </p>
            <p>Most of the SQL database programs also have their own proprietary extensions in addition to the SQL standard!</p>
            <h2>SQL injection</h2>
            <p>
                This vulnerability enables an attacker to submit crafted input to interfere with the application’s interaction with back-end databases.
 An attacker may be able to retrieve arbitrary data from the application, interfere with its logic, or execute commands on the database 
server itself.
            </p>
            <h2>Client-Side SQL Injection</h2>
            <p>
                HTML5 supports client-side SQL databases, which applications can use to store 
data on the client. An attacker may be able to perform client-side SQL injection attacks by including crafted input in a piece of data he controls, which the 
application stores locally.  Depending on exactly how the application uses the local database, serious attacks may be possible.

            <h2>What is MongoDB?</h2>
            <p>
                mongoDB is one of the NoSQL databases, And stores data in JSON-like documents, which makes the database very flexible and scalable.</p>
            <h2>Injecting into MongoDB</h2>
            <p>
                Many NoSQL databases make use of existing programming languages to provide a flexible, programmable query mechanism. 
If queries are built using string concatenation, an attacker can attempt to break out of the data context and alter the query’s syntax.
            </p>
            <p>
                Databases don’t always use SQL. NoSQL, or Not Only SQL, databases are those that don’t use the SQL language. 
Unlike SQL databases, which store data in tables, NoSQL databases store data in other structures, such as key-value pairs and graphs. 
NoSQL query syntax is database-specific, and queries are often written in the programming language of the application. 
Modern NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, and Apache Cassandra, are also vulnerable to injection attacks. 
These vulnerabilities are becoming more common as NoSQL rises in popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In MongoDB, $ne selects objects whose value is not equal to the specified value. Here, the query would return users whose username is admin
and password isn’t equal to an empty string, which is true unless the admin has a blank password! The attacker can thus bypass authentication and gain access to the admin account.
Injecting into MongoDB queries can also allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server.
            </p>
            <p>In MongoDB, the $where, mapReduce, $accumulator, and $function operations allow developers to run arbitrary JavaScript.</p>
