                    <p>
                        Software vulnerabilities are as old as software itself. Simply put, software
                        vulnerabilities are weakness in either the design or implementation of software that may
                        be exploited by an attacker. It should be noted that not all bugs are vulnerabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>   
                        In 2015, Synopsys produced a report that showed the results of analyzing 10 billion lines of
                        code. The study showed that commercial code had 0.61 defects per 1,000 lines of code
                        (LoC), whereas open source software had 0.76 defects per 1,000 LoC; however, the
                        same study showed that commercial code did better when compared against industry
                        standards, such as OWASP Top 10.
                    </p>
                            <h2># Common methods of disclosure</h2>
                            <h2>Full vendor disclosure</h2> 
                    <p>
                            Starting around the year 2000, some researchers were more likely to cooperate with
                        vendors and perform full vendor disclosure, whereby the researcher would disclose the
                        vulnerability to the vendor fully and would not disclose to any other parties.
                    </p>
                            <h2>Full public disclosure</h2>
                    <p>
                            In 2002, the infamous Full Disclosure mailing list was born
                        and served as a vehicle for more than a decade, where researchers freely posted
                        vulnerability details, with or without vendor notification.
                    </p>
                            <h2>Responsible disclosure</h2>
                    <p>
                            In some ways, the aforementioned Rain Forest Puppy took
                        the first step toward responsible disclosure, in that he gave vendors one week to
                        establish meaningful communication, and as long as they maintained that communication,
                        he would not disclose the vulnerability. In this manner, a compromise can be made
                        between the researcher and vendor, and as long as the vendor cooperates, the researcher
                        will as well. This seemed to be the best of both worlds and started a new method of
                        vulnerability disclosure.
                    </p>
                            <h3><b>NB</b> All of these methods of vulnerability disclosure are free,
                        whereby the security researcher spends countless hours finding security vulnerabilities
                        and, for various reasons not directly tied to financial compensation, discloses the
                        vulnerability for the public good.</h3>

                            <h2>No More Free Bugs</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 2009, the game changed. At the annual CanSecWest conference, three famous
                        hackers, Charlie Miller, Dino Dai Zovi, and Alex Sotirov, made a stand.
                        In a presentation led by Miller, Dai Zovi and Sotirov held up a cardboard sign that read
                        “NO MORE FREE BUGS.” It was only a matter of time before researchers became
                        more vocal about the disproportionate number of hours required to research and
                        discover vulnerabilities versus the amount of compensation received by researchers.
                    </p>
                      
                            <h2>Bug Bounty Programs</h2>
                    <p>    
                        The phrase “bug bounty” was first used in 1995 by Jarrett Ridlinghafer at Netscape
                        Communication Corporation. Along the way, iDefense (later purchased by VeriSign)
                        and TippingPoint helped the bounty process by acting as middlemen between
                        researchers and software, facilitating the information flow and remuneration. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2004,the Mozilla Foundation formed a bug bounty for Firefox. In 2007, the Pwn2Own competition 
                        was started at CanSecWest and served as a pivot point in the security field,
                        as researchers would gather to demonstrate vulnerabilities and their exploits for prizes
                        and cash. Later, in 2010, Google started its program, followed by Facebook in 2011,
                        followed by the Microsoft Online Services program in 2014. Now there are hundreds
                        of companies offering bounties on vulnerabilities.
